As a recent graduate with a degree in NEILIT 'O'Level,'A'Level and 'B'Level, I am excited to embark on a career in web design and development. <br><br><br>

        During my studies, I developed a deep understanding of programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, as well as web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I am also familiar with popular design tools like Adobe Photoshop and Figma, and have experience working with content management systems like WordPress and Libreoffice. <br><br><br>
